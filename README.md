# nvim-config

This repo contains my Neovim config, which has been adapted / inspired largely from the work of:

- [TJ DeVries](https://github.com/tjdevries/config_manager)
- [Josean Martinez](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files)

## Getting started

Rather than using this repo as-is, I'd suggest getting started with [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), and then drawing from this repo as needed.
